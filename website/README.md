## Overview
The website that we have made is based on this game called Hearthstone. It is an online card game that allows players to build their own deck of 30 cards and battle it out against other players online.

The main purpose of this website is to allow players to find information on the cards that are available currently in the game. Based on the current patch, the total number of playing cards now is more than two thousand, so its not easy to remember all the card's information, which is why this website comes in handy.

## Design Process





**User Stories**
1. As a player, I want to find out more about a card that I have encountered during a game of mine so i can devise a strategy to play against that card.

1. As a player, I want to know how to get a specific card back that looks nice and add it to my collection.

1. As a non-player, I want to know whether Hearthstone has nice designs of their cards and card backs that pique my interest in playing the game

## Features
